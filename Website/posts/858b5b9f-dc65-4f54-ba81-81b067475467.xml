  <content>&lt;p&gt;I am at the point in one's trip abroad where everything is frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say what you will, it is really annoying that it takes me a half an hour to log into Facebook. I mean, I realize that Facebook and the Internet in general are a luxury, especially here. It is just frustrating to know that you can have something that you use daily elsewhere without a problem. Still annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next one that is weird, if I haven't already mentioned it, is the crazy traffic in Guilin. There are tons of cars and mopeds on the road. However, there seem to be absolutely no traffic laws, or laws that are followed. Crossing the street, because the traffic lights are on only at rush hour, is like playing a horrifying game of Frogger. One of my classmates has keenly described it as an&amp;nbsp;exercise in applied chaos theory. I will snap some photos of this&amp;nbsp;phenomenon tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

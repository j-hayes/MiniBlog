  <content>&lt;p&gt;So here I am in Qingdao, the roughing it portion of my trip is officially over (unless plans change and I feel like going back out in to the boonies.) I have spent my entire time here since arriving at the hostel, getting caught up on blogging and uploading pictures / fighting my website code. I am basically on top of it now.&amp;nbsp;Still working on image uploading, but there should be enough new stuff to keep you all entertained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am past the half way point in the trip. I was quite home sick the last couple days because I didn't have sufficient Internet&amp;nbsp;connection nor time to call back home. That has been solved and dealt with properly. Now I can continue onwards. I plan on using today as a day to recoup and do nothing. That and you know figure out where I am going to next.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check in later for more about my invasion of Beijing from the north.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

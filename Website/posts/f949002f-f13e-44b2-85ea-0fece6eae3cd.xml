  <content>&lt;p&gt;I need to learn from experience. I often find myself walking to somewhere I have been before and have general sense of where I am. In these situations I often just follow my internal compass and logical reasoning skills. This method gets me places, just not the ones I intend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maps, asking directions, and public transit or cabs should be used instead of my method.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit it, I am not very good with directions. It's a good thing I'm stubborn and persistent or many times I would have found myself clutching my knees crying in a back alley.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <content>&lt;p&gt;I am exhusted, I forgot to eat, my body hates me. Running on about 6 hours of sleep in 48 hours. So basically I am running on pure will power. I just need to stay awake for maybe two more hours and I will be fine for tomorrow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really am really not keen on the area that I am staying in,&amp;nbsp;Tsim Sha Tsui. It is just a giant assortment of high end designer shops and other random shopping. I didn't fly half way across the world to go to a shopping mall or to see a Starbucks next to a McDonalds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get me to the mainland or give me a new perspective, or to put it another way, get me some sleep or get me on a sleeper train.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

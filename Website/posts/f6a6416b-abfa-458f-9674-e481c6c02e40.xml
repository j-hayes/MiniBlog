  <content>&lt;p&gt;I got to the Shanghai Hongqiao train station very early this morning. I needed to get my ticket before the train left at 6:30 am for Xiamen&amp;nbsp;where I currently sit. After mulling about the giant high-speed rail station for a few minutes looking for an open ticket window I found the line I was supposed to be in. They had not opened yet, but the LED sign above flashed that it would be open in about ten minutes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited in line and progressed quickly because unlike the usual ticket line, there were only about 15 people in the line and I was half way up the line by the time the window opened.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the important bit is that the line next to my line didn't open. After realizing that it wasn't opening the people in that line began to try to merge into my line. I was next in line at this point. A middle aged man tried to cut me in line. I simply looked at him, prepared with the well practiced words, 排队啊. Surprisingly when the guy in front of me was done, the middle aged man stepped aside and I went up to the window. Jackson 1- China (this number is uncountable probably something like (n = my score:) n^n! )&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
